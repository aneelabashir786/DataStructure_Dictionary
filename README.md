# DataStructure_Dictionary

##Introduction:

My project is about dictionary . Which contain a great number of words along with their meaning .The dictionary txt file have been provided .
 
##Chaining Hashing :

In this project I have used chaining hashing .	The whole dictionary has been loaded by chaining hashing . 

Chaining is a technique used for avoiding collisions in hash tables. A collision occurs when two keys are hashed to the same index in a hash table. Collisions are a problem because every slot in a hash table is supposed to store a single element. Chaining hashing ends up collision by making linked list . It make it fast to access any element 

All other details are in "Project and Dataset Details" file .
